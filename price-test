                    <h2>
                        I’VE NEVER DONE A BARRE PILATES OR YOGA CLASS BEFORE. WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT?                   
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Congratulations! We’re so excited you’ve chosen to start the journey 
                        that will change your life at Spark! Remember, it is impossible to learn
                        everything right away, and even those students who have practiced for many
                        years will tell you that they are constantly learning. We just ask that 
                        you come with an open mind and be prepared to breathe, move and sweat! We
                        promise to do everything we can to support you. Just remember, wherever you
                        are right NOW is a perfect place to start!
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        WHAT DO I BRING TO CLASS?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Please bring a yoga mat, water bottle and towel. We practice barefoot
                        and recommend that you wear clothes that are light, comfortable, breathable
                        and non-restrictive. Non-skid socks are optional for barre and pilates
                        equipment classes.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        IS IT NECESSARY TO SIGN UP BEFORE CLASS?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        No. However, it is a great way to schedule it into your week and ensure
                        that you stay committed to your practice!
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        WHEN SHOULD I ARRIVE FOR CLASS?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Please arrive for class approximately 10 mins before class commences. 
                        We recommend coming 15 mins early on your first visit, so that we have 
                        enough time to get you set up.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        WHY IS THE ROOM HEATED DURING YOGA?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The studio is heated to approx 85 degrees for our yoga classes. We
                        believe that a heated room increases your pulse rate and metabolism, 
                        making circulation easier and increasing blood flow to the limbs. Warm
                        muscles lessen the risk of injury and allow your body to move more 
                        freely. Sweating helps control your internal body temperature and combined
                        with yoga poses, helps with detoxification. For endurance athletes and
                        triathletes, practicing yoga in a heated environment is also beneficial
                        for building heat tolerance.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        CAN I EAT BEFORE CLASS?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        It is best to practice on a nearly empty stomach. We recommend not 
                        eating any heavy meals 1-2 hours before class. Just think, twisting and
                        going upside down on a full stomach can’t feel good!
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        CAN I PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS IF I HAVE AN INJURY OR I AM PREGNANT?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        As with any exercise program, you should check with your physician 
                        and continue to listen to your own body for signs of overwork or that
                        you are aggravating your injury. Our classes can be practiced by anyone,
                        as long as modifications are taken to accommodate your individual needs.
                        Private sessions are a great way to start your practice as our teachers can
                        focus all their time and energy on you, giving you the adjustments and
                        modifications specific to your unique practice. Please be sure to include
                        details when you first sign up and inform your instructor before class.
