                <h1>Barre Fusion Pilates Pilates</h1>
                <p>
                    Barre Fusion Pilates Pilates is known
                    to stretch, strengthen, gain flexibility and balance your body, while 
                    connecting the mind with the body. Strengthening the abdomen, lower 
                    back, hips and butt is the biggest benefit that you will get while 
                    practicing Pilates. At Spark, we incorporate these Pilates principles with
                    strength training and ballet-inspired barre exercises into our Barre 
                    classes, resulting in stronger, toned and leaner muscles while  maintaining
                    flexibility and range of motion. All levels
                </p>
                <h1>Barre Fusion FUNdamentals </h1>
                <p> 
                    Barre Fusion Pilates class for those new to barre pilates or 
                    experienced students who want to focus on fundamental alignment 
                    principles. An intense workout, with less variations and repetitions. 
                    Beginner, intermediate levels
                </p>
                <h1>Mat Pilates at the Barre </h1>
                <p>
                    Emphasis is placed on classical and modern Mat Pilates exercises 
                    with the use of Pilates props such as the small ball, stretch band, 
                    Pilates ring and foam roller, but spiced up with a few of your favorite 
                    booty burning Barre moves. The variety in Mat Pilates at the Barre 
                    classes ensures that each Pilates workout provides a total body workout
                    that strengthens the core, tones the hips and thighs, and flattens the abs.

                <h2>Please note that unless otherwise stated, all yoga classes are heated 
                    between 80 and 85 degrees. We do occasionally keep the room a little cooler
                    in the warmer months when the humidity levels are high. In those instances
                    of extreme heat, the room will be left at room temperature (approx 76 deg)
                    with no additional heat sources.

                <h1>Heated Vinyasa Yoga – All levels</h1>
                <p>
                    Vinyasa yoga - a moderate-paced flowing and empowering style of yoga that allows
                    students of all levels to be challenged in the same class. You will gradually build
                    deeper internal warmth as we explore a variety of sun salutations, standing postures,
                    core integration practices, arm balances, backbends, twists, forward bends, hip
                    openers and inversions. While alignment cues and clear instruction are given, emphasis
                    is placed on the need to listen to your own body and move intuitively with freedom – this
                    is yoga with awareness.
                    <br><br>
                    Modifications are given for all levels.      
                </p>
                
                <h1>Yoga Foundations</h1>
                <p>
                    Class is geared to those newer to yoga or wanting to develop a strong vinyasa
                    yoga foundation based on the fundamental postures of Ashtanga Yoga. You will learn
                    to build a practice based on a combination of posture, breath and concentration to
                    form a moving meditation. Experienced yogis may enjoy the opportunity to refine your
                    current yoga practice and ask any questions that arise out of your current practice.
                </p>

                <h1>Restore &amp; Renew </h1>
                <p>
                    This restorative yoga class focuses on active relaxation, providing the body an
                    opportunity to renew and heal. With the use of simple props including foam rollers,
                    balls, yoga straps and blankets, we alternately stimulate and relax the body to move
                    toward balance.
                    <br><br>
                    Class consists of longer holds of passive poses to get to the connective tissue,
                    allowing you to slow down and create space for stillness while nourishing joints,
                    ligaments, tendons and fascia. Many of the poses are seated, supine or prone. There
                    is a focus on the breath, being present in the moment, relieving tension and letting
                    go. Give yourself this opportunity to surrender, slow down and come back to balance.
                    This yin-like practice is a great complement to our regular vinyasa classes, as well
                    as for athletes and highly stressed individuals! As much as possible, this class is
                    taught intuitively to serve the particular needs of the students in attendance.
                    <br><br>

                <h1>Long Slow Deep</h1>
                <p>
                    Detox and unwind after a long day. A practice perfect for beginners, seasoned
                    practitioners and everyone in between, combining the elements of slow flow, restorative
                    yoga and pranayama. Students explore all the benefits of each posture within the
                    boundaries and framework of their own individual expressions. We move and approach
                    each posture with an added sense of getting deeper into our bodies with slower
                    transitions and longer holds.
                </p>
            
                <h1>Early Bird Yoga (Rise &amp; Shine)</h1>

                    early morning yoga class offers an energetic way to begin your day, with messy hair
                    and all. This is a fun and flowing class that is appropriate for all levels 
                    (though some experience with Sun Salutations A and B would be beneficial). You will
                    leave this class feeling refreshed and ready for your day.

                    Sleepyheads are welcome! (Tip: find it tough to get up in time for class? Go to bed
                    in your yoga gear or at least lay out your clothes!)

                <h1>Beginners Yoga Workshop Series</h1>
                <p>
                    This special series is designed to safely and comfortably introduce new students to
                    the physical practice of yoga. In a relaxed, supportive environment, you'll learn the
                    foundational yoga postures through a step-by-step approach which focuses on proper
                    form and alignment. Detailed instructions (including modifications for all needs/abilities),
                    demonstrations, and personal hands-on adjustments are provided. We'll go slowly so you
                    can ask questions which will help you develop good habits from the start. Breathing and
                    meditation techniques are also taught to help reduce stress by quieting and focusing the
                    mind (can be used on or off the mat). At the end of the workshop series, you'll be
                    prepared to transition into our all- levels classes.

                <p>
                    Private training involves individual instruction tailored to your fitness level
                    and your body’s specific needs. Because these sessions are specially designed for
                    each individual’s personal circumstances, they can include any combination of yoga,
                    barre pilates and pilates equipment training. Perfect for those with injuries or have
                    a specific health and wellness goal to meet.
                    <br><br>
                    Semi-Private sessions offer the same individualized instruction with the 
                    opportunity to share the experience with one or two partners. Most effective
                    if group participants are of a similar fitness level.

                <h1>Pilates Equipment</h1>
                <p>
                    The Pilates Reformer and Chair use springs, pulleys, bars &amp; straps to perform
                    an infinite number of exercises in a variety of positions. The equipment was originally
                    developed to offer movement and rehab to the injured, but today it offers a more
                    challenging version of the Pilates mat work. Because of the reformer's attachments,
                    it is also an ideal option for those who need modifications to the mat exercises.
                    Pilates Equipment classes allow for more individualized instruction. At Spark, we work
                    with a wide variety of students, from rehabilitation focused to extremely challenging for
                    even the most seasoned athlete.
                    <br><br>
                    We have many groups at Spark and we know we can find the right one for you! And if
                    you have a time you would like to work out but you don't see it on our schedule, please
                    contact us because we may be able to make it happen! Perhaps you have a group of 3
                    friends and would like to start your own group!
