                <span style="font-weight: 700;">Barre Fusion Pilates Pilates</span> is known
                to stretch, strengthen, gain flexibility and balance your body, while 
                connecting the mind with the body. Strengthening the abdomen, lower 
                back, hips and butt is the biggest benefit that you will get while 
                practicing Pilates. At Spark, we incorporate these Pilates principles with
                strength training and ballet-inspired barre exercises into our Barre 
                classes, resulting in stronger, toned and leaner muscles while  maintaining
                flexibility and range of motion. All levels

                Barre Fusion Pilates class for those new to barre pilates or 
                experienced students who want to focus on fundamental alignment 
                principles. An intense workout, with less variations and repetitions.

                Emphasis is placed on classical and modern Mat Pilates exercises 
                with the use of Pilates props such as the small ball, stretch band, 
                Pilates ring and foam roller, but spiced up with a few of your favorite 
                booty burning Barre moves. The variety in Mat Pilates at the Barre 
                classes ensures that each Pilates workout provides a total body workout
                that strengthens the core, tones the hips and thighs, and flattens the abs.

            <h2>Please note that unless otherwise stated, all yoga classes are heated between 80 and 85 degrees. We do occasionally keep the room a little cooler in the warmer months when the humidity levels are high. In those instances of extreme heat, the room will be left at room temperature (approx 76 deg) with no additional heat sources.</h2>
            <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 700;">Heated Vinyasa Yoga – All levels</span><br>
Vinyasa yoga - a moderate-paced flowing and empowering style of yoga that allows students of all levels to be challenged in the same class. You will gradually build deeper internal warmth as we explore a variety of sun salutations, standing postures, core integration practices, arm balances, backbends, twists, forward bends, hip openers and inversions. While alignment cues and clear instruction are given, emphasis is placed on the need to listen to your own body and move intuitively with freedom – this is yoga with awareness.
<br><br>
Modifications are given for all levels.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 700;">Yoga Foundations</span><br>
Class is geared to those newer to yoga or wanting to develop a strong vinyasa yoga foundation based on the fundamental postures of Ashtanga Yoga. You will learn to build a practice based on a combination of posture, breath and concentration to form a moving meditation. Experienced yogis may enjoy the opportunity to refine your current yoga practice and ask any questions that arise out of your current practice.
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 700;">Restore &amp; Renew</span><br>
This restorative yoga class focuses on active relaxation, providing the body an opportunity to renew and heal. With the use of simple props including foam rollers, balls, yoga straps and blankets, we alternately stimulate and relax the body to move toward balance.

Class consists of longer holds of passive poses to get to the connective tissue, allowing you to slow down and create space for stillness while nourishing joints, ligaments, tendons and fascia. Many of the poses are seated, supine or prone. There is a focus on the breath, being present in the moment, relieving tension and letting go. Give yourself this opportunity to surrender, slow down and come back to balance. This yin-like practice is a great complement to our regular vinyasa classes, as well as for athletes and highly stressed individuals! As much as possible, this class is taught intuitively to serve the particular needs of the students in attendance.
<br><br>
Class is taught at room temperature.
    </p>
   <p>         
<span style="font-weight: 700;">Long Slow Deep</span><br>
Detox and unwind after a long day. A practice perfect for beginners, seasoned practitioners and everyone in between, combining the elements of slow flow, restorative yoga and pranayama. Students explore all the benefits of each posture within the boundaries and framework of their own individual expressions. We move and approach each posture with an added sense of getting deeper into our bodies with slower transitions and longer holds.
<p>
<span style="font-weight: 700;">Early Bird Yoga (Rise &amp; Shine)</span><br>
Welcome in the morning sun and get your day started with this 45 minute class! The early morning yoga class offers an energetic way to begin your day, with messy hair and all. This is a fun and flowing class that is appropriate for all levels (though some experience with Sun Salutations A and B would be beneficial). You will leave this class feeling refreshed and ready for your day.
<br><br>
Sleepyheads are welcome! (Tip: find it tough to get up in time for class? Go to bed in your yoga gear or at least lay out your clothes!)
</p>
            <p>
<span style="font-weight: 700;">Yoga Body Bootcamp</span><br>

<span style="font-weight: 700;">Beginners Yoga Workshop Series</span><br>
This special series is designed to safely and comfortably introduce new students to the physical practice of yoga. In a relaxed, supportive environment, you'll learn the foundational yoga postures through a step-by-step approach which focuses on proper form and alignment. Detailed instructions (including modifications for all needs/abilities), demonstrations, and personal hands-on adjustments are provided. We'll go slowly so you can ask questions which will help you develop good habits from the start. Breathing and meditation techniques are also taught to help reduce stress by quieting and focusing the mind (can be used on or off the mat). At the end of the workshop series, you'll be prepared to transition into our all- levels classes.

            <h2>Our Pilates &amp; Barre classes are taught at cooler temperatures</h2>
            <p>
                Private training involves individual instruction tailored to your fitness level and your body’s specific needs. Because these sessions are specially designed for each individual’s personal circumstances, they can include any combination of yoga, barre pilates and pilates equipment training. Perfect for those with injuries or have a specific health and wellness goal to meet.
<br><br>
Semi-Private sessions offer the same individualized instruction with the opportunity to share the experience with one or two partners. Most effective if group participants are of a similar fitness level.
            </p>
            <p>
<span style="font-weight: 700;">Pilates Equipment</span><br>
The Pilates Reformer and Chair use springs, pulleys, bars &amp; straps to perform an infinite number of exercises in a variety of positions. The equipment was originally developed to offer movement and rehab to the injured, but today it offers a more challenging version of the Pilates mat work. Because of the reformer's attachments, it is also an ideal option for those who need modifications to the mat exercises. Pilates Equipment classes allow for more individualized instruction. At Spark, we work with a wide variety of students, from rehabilitation focused to extremely challenging for even the most seasoned athlete.
<br><br>
We have many groups at Spark and we know we can find the right one for you! And if you have a time you would like to work out but you don't see it on our schedule, please contact us because we may be able to make it happen! Perhaps you have a group of 3 friends and would like to start your own group!
