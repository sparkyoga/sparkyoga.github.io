We are a humble boutique studio in Urbandale, with a friendly and welcoming environment. Highly trained, motivated, intuitive &amp; encouraging teachers empower students towards physical and mental well-being. Smaller classes means you don't get lost in the crowd and we are able to teach you to modify and adapt your practice to YOUR needs. We can also hold you accountable if you need it! Our classes are unique, creative and intentionally sequenced.
<br><br>
We also believe in balance. We offer classes that include those that are more focused on strength building, yoga classes that flow at a faster or slower pace, classes that are focused on building foundations. We also offer more restorative classes to recharge and help the body’s natural healing process. Challenging yourself opens the door to growth and often means hard work, but not always "pain" before you see benefits. Our classes offer many physical benefits such as improved flexibility, strength, joint mobility/stability, posture and circulation. We offer a caring community that invites you to come as you are and explore your own edge mindfully, as you grow into your own practice, strengthen your body, expand your heart and free your mind. We believe there is no quick fix or short-cut to lifelong health and fitness. It takes discipline, determination and patience.
<br><br>
We love our students and are so thankful for each and every one of them. It’s a common thing to show up before a class in a room filled with lively discussion as we visit with each other and share life. Take a great class and then maybe stay for spontaneous treats from another fellow student! If you’re someone who prefers to lie down or sit quietly before class starts with your eyes closed to center yourself and draw within, we welcome that too. We just ask that you come as you are and have an open mind to experience new possibilities. And ask questions – we like questions. We don’t always have all the answers, but boy will we do our best to help!

“Yoga is philosophy in motion, there is no quick fix, no short cut to physical health and fitness, just a process, 
and in yoga the goal is the process.” – Baron Baptiste
