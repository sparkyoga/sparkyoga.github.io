                    <h1>About Spark</h1>
                    <p>
                        We are a humble boutique studio in Urbandale, with a friendly and welcoming 
                        environment. Highly trained, motivated, intuitive &amp; encouraging teachers
                        empower students towards physical and mental well-being. Smaller classes means
                        you don't get lost in the crowd and we are able to teach you to modify and adapt
                        your practice to YOUR needs. We can also hold you accountable if you need it! Our
                        classes are unique, creative and intentionally sequenced. 
                        <br><br>
                        We also believe in balance. We offer classes that include those that are more 
                        focused on strength building, yoga classes that flow at a faster or slower pace,
                        classes that are focused on building foundations. We also offer more restorative
                        classes to recharge and help the body’s natural healing process. Challenging yourself
                        opens the door to growth and often means hard work, but not always "pain" before you
                        see benefits. Our classes offer many physical benefits such as improved flexibility,
                        strength, joint mobility/stability, posture and circulation. We offer a caring community
                        that invites you to come as you are and explore your own edge mindfully, as you grow into
                        your own practice, strengthen your body, expand your heart and free your mind. We believe
                        there is no quick fix or short-cut to lifelong health and fitness. It takes discipline,
                        determination and patience. 
                        <br><br>
                        We love our students and are so thankful for each and every one of them. It’s a common
                        thing to show up before a class in a room filled with lively discussion as we visit
                        with each other and share life. Take a great class and then maybe stay for spontaneous
                        treats from another fellow student! If you’re someone who prefers to lie down or sit
                        quietly before class starts with your eyes closed to center yourself and draw within,
                        we welcome that too. We just ask that you come as you are and have an open mind to
                        experience new possibilities. And ask questions – we like questions. We don’t always
                        have all the answers, but boy will we do our best to help! 
                        <br><br>
                        “Yoga is philosophy in motion, there is no quick fix, no short cut to physical health
                        and fitness, just a process, and in yoga the goal is the process.” – Baron Baptiste
