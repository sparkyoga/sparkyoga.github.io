            <h1>Pauline Tan</h1>
            <h2>Owner</h2>
            <p>I started practicing yoga when I was working in the corporate world about 16 years ago. I found it to be a great way to stretch and release stress while also building strength. Since my first yoga training experience at Level 1 training with Baron Baptiste, I've since completed a 500-hr yoga training and comprehensive Pilates training. I have also attended hundreds of hours of additional training and workshops including, Ashtanga Yoga, Universal Yoga, Yoga for Athletes, Yoga Life Coaching, Yoga Body Bootcamp, Booty Barre, anatomy and numerous Pilates conferences and trainings.
           
There are so many ways to practice and there are so many other aspects of yoga to explore deeper like pranayama and meditation. I love how teaching yoga consistently brings me out of my comfort zone, and opening my first studio has definitely challenged me even more. Like many others, the physical practice of yoga was what first drew me in. And while I still love practicing yoga asana, whether it be playing in arm balances or inversions, or a more restorative practice after triathlon training, I love yoga even more for the mental and emotional benefits. Yoga is a daily practice for me and constantly challenges me to draw inward and focus on what my body and mind need, balancing strength with agility, stability with mobility, and most importantly, effort with ease. Pilates Equipment workouts are my go-to for strength and complement my yoga practice and triathlon training perfectly.

My heart’s desire is to empower you to be the best that YOU can be. Whether it be starting a yoga practice for the first time, learning that one fun posture you’ve always wanted to try, recovering from injuries or building strength, it is one of my greatest privileges to play a part in your journey.

When I’m not at the studio, I enjoy competing in triathlons and spending time with family and friends. Our family loves to travel and views the world as a wonderful and limitless place of possibilities and food to savour!
